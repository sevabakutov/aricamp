Task 1.1: Default values, cloning and copying
=============================================




## Default values

🏠 [Rust] has a standard way to deal with default values of a type via [`Default`]⏱0.25h trait. Read through 📚 [its official docs][`Default`]⏱0.25h to understand the design.

It can be auto-derived, but only for a `struct` whose all members have 📚 [`Default`]⏱0.25h implementations. It is implemented for a great many types in the standard library, and also used in a surprising number of places. So if your type has a value that can be construed as being "default", it is a good idea to implement this trait.

If you're not satisfied with 📚 [std] deriving capabilities for 📚 [`Default`]⏱0.25h, consider using 📚 [smart-default] crate. An example is quite self-explanatory:
```rust
#[derive(SmartDefault)]
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    #[default]
    Baz {
        #[default = 12]
        a: i32,
        b: i32,
        #[default(Some(Default::default()))]
        c: Option<i32>,
        #[default(_code = "vec![1, 2, 3]")]
        d: Vec<u32>,
        #[default = "four"]
        e: String,
    },
    Qux(i32),
}
```

A great thing that having a 📚 [`Default`]⏱0.25h implementation you can instantiate your `struct` with only the non-default values and have all other fields filled with default values:
```rust
let x = Foo { bar: baz, ..Default::default() };
```




## Cloning and copying

By default, all types in 🏠 [Rust] follow ❓ ['move semantics'][1]⏱0.5h.

If you need a duplicate of a value, then its type should implement [`Clone`]⏱0.75h trait (see 📚 [official docs][`Clone`]⏱0.75h), and a duplicate is created by calling [`Clone`]⏱0.75h methods __explicitly__. Cloning can be __either cheap or expensive__ operation depending on type semantics.

However, [`Copy`]⏱0.25h marker trait (see 📚 [official docs][`Copy`]⏱0.25h) enables 'copy semantics' for a type, so a value is __copied implicitly__ every time is passed. That's why copying must always perform a __simple bit-to-bit copy operation__.

📚 [Official `Copy` docs][`Copy`]⏱0.25h are quite explanatory about which types _should_ be [`Copy`]⏱0.25h and which types _cannot_:

> Some types can't be copied safely. For example, copying `&mut T` would create an aliased mutable reference. Copying `String` would duplicate responsibility for managing the `String`'s buffer, leading to a double free.
>
> Generalizing the latter case, any type implementing `Drop` can't be `Copy`, because it's managing some resource besides its own `size_of::<T>` bytes.

> Generally speaking, if your type can implement `Copy`, it should. Keep in mind, though, that implementing `Copy` is part of the public API of your type. If the type might become non-`Copy` in the future, it could be prudent to omit the `Copy` implementation now, to avoid a breaking API change.

## Task

__Estimated time__: 1 day




- Create a `Point` type which represents a 2D point (`x` and `y` coordinates). This type has to be `Copy` and `Default`.
- Create a `Polyline` type which represents a non-empty collection(whichever you want) of `Point`s of unknown size. This type has to be `Clone` and non-`Default`.
    - Polyline must implement basic collection methods: addition of an item, removal of an item,
      getting an item. You may add additional methods & features if you desire.




## Questions

After completing everything above, you should be able to answer (and understand why) the following questions:
1. What purpose does 📚 [`Default`]⏱0.25h trait serve in 🏠 [Rust]? (it allows creating struct with default values of its fields)
2. What is `#[derive(Default)]` from `std` capable of? What does it wrong? Which are alternatives? (it's capable of implementing default fields values for structure where every field implements default trait, idk, implement default trait with default method on your own)
3. What does 📚 [`Clone`]⏱0.75h mean semantically? (clone always makes new data, it can be cheap or expensive cheap if we clone smart pointers... and expensive if we clone data on heap like string, vec..., if we clone something on heap but not smart pointer we get new identical data on heap with new pointer to it)
4. What does 📚 [`Copy`]⏱0.25h mean semantically? How is it connected with 📚 [`Clone`]⏱0.75h? Which limitations does it have and why? (copy copies data bit to bit, it can be implicated only if struct implements clone, can only copy types which are located in stack because of rust ownership rules)
